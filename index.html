<p>RBO is a simple and robust broadcast-scheduling protocol minimizing
'tuning-time/energy' of the receiver.
It's idea is based on an interesting property of the bit-reversal permutation.
The broadcast cycle is a sorted sequence of keys of length 2^k, permuted by k-bit-reversal
permutation. 
The broadcast cycle is broadcast in 'round-robin' fashion by the sender.
The receiver wants to receive some key from the broadcast cycle.
It uses a simple RBO protocol that listens to some samples of the broadcast cycle.
It may start at any time during the broadcasting and, due to the properties of bit-reversal,
the number of samples to be received is very low, thus saving the energy consumed
by the radio receptions.</p>

<p>Informal description of the protocol with references to the technical reports
can be found at: 
    <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/rboprotocol/">https://sites.google.com/site/rboprotocol/</a></p>

<p>This directory contains a prototype of 
the RBO protocol with a simple test application (and some other code in Java used for testing RBO).</p>

<p>The files Rbo*.java contain implementation of the modules
of the protocol.</p>

<p>The files Tiny*.java contain emulations of the TinyOS 
components used by RBO.</p>

<p>The files *Events.java are specifications (parts of module's interfaces) 
of the events signalled by the corresponding modules.</p>

<p>To compile the programs run in this directory:</p>

<p>javac *.java</p>

<h2>
<a id="simple-test-application" class="anchor" href="#simple-test-application" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>SIMPLE TEST APPLICATION:</h2>

<p>To start simple test application of the protocol run:</p>

<p>java TestApplication logSequenceLength timeSlotLength</p>

<p>where 
   logSequenceLength is logarithm of the length of the transmitted sequence
   (here it should be less than 30 - we are using Java type int)
and 
  timeSlotLength is the time between transmissions of consecutive elements
   (in milliseconds) 
This program creates two windows: for the sender and for the receiver. 
(* Note that, initially, one window may be covered by the other. Use the mouse to relocate them. *)
The keys in the sequence broadcast by the sender are consecutive positive 
odd numbers (starting from 1),
while the receiver selects as the searched key a random integer
between 0 and 1+(maximum of the broadcast sequence).
There is also simple menu in the terminal for printing statistics
and stopping/restarting the receiver/sender.</p>

<p>The messages in the receivers' window are printed after completion of each search.
They look like this:</p>

<p>50.searchDone: ERR:2 MSG: H:ID=2 LSL=13 TSL=2 KEY=15769 RNK=7884 P:7884</p>

<p>ERR - status of the result ( 0 - SUCCESS, 1 - TIME_OUT, 2 - KEY_NOT_PRESENT)
ID -  sequence ID
LSL - logarithm of sequence length
TSL - time of sequence length
KEY - the key in last received message
RNK - rank of the key
P   - payload</p>

<p>The messages in the senders' window are printed after each round of 
sequence transmission.</p>

<p>The time in statistics is given in milliseconds.</p>

<p>(* Note that it is 'real-time' simulation. 
Hence, the time intervals between subsequent messages 
may be quite long for large broadcast cycles. *)</p>
